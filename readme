Assignment number: Two

This assignment helped me practice pointer notations and arithmetics as well as string manipulations. While working in this assignment,
I have recieved help from course professors, TAs, fellow classmates and my seniors. The interaction in the campuswire helped me solve some
problems in my code. I recieved much help from my senior (Amanuel Assefa) during the debugging of my code. I used pointer notations for the 
entire part 1 of the assignment so as to get extra credits. In the function StrToLong, I used the code we are given in the assignment 
ducumentaion for number string to int value conversion. I spent roughly 25 hours on this assignment. 

My answer to the question "Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller
is large enough? Explain" is:
No it is not possible. This is because we only have the pointer of the string and there is no way to determine the length of the string 
based only on the pointer.
